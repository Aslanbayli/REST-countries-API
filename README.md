## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TypeScript 
- [TailWind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [API](https://restcountries.com/) - Enpoints

## What I learned

This was my first independent React project. By the completion of this project, I can say I have solid understanding of `React`, `Tailwind CSS`, and `REST ful API's`. 

## Future plans

I am plannig on improving some minor UI features and adding more functionality such as navigation to countries via clicking on `border countries` on details page. As well as, improve mobile responsiveness.
